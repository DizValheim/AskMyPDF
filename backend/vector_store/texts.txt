Introduction/Motivation
Computer network security relies heavily on cryptography to
protect data transmitted over networks from unauthorized
access and tampering. It ensures that sensitive information,
such as passwords, personal data, and financial transactions,
remains secure during transmission. Protocols like SSL/TLS
utilize cryptographic techniques to establish encrypted
connections over the internet, thereby safeguarding websites
and online communications. Additionally, technologies such as
Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and firewalls employ
cryptographic tools to enable secure remote access and defend
internal networks against external threats. Collectively,
cryptography and network security measures form the
foundation of modern secure communication systems.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a system that uses public
and private keys to secure digital communication. It ensures
encryption, authentication, and data integrity through digital
certificates issued by trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs). PKI
is widely used in HTTPS websites, digital signatures, and
secure emails to build trust and protect sensitive information
online.

Encryption
Encryption is a technique that transforms readable data
(plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using a
specific algorithm and key. This process ensures that the data
remains secure and can only be decoded by those with the
correct key, protecting it from unauthorized access.
Encryptions can be classified as follows:
Symmetric encryption: Same key for encryption and
decryption.
Asymmetric encryption: Different keys for encryption and
decryption.

Types of Classical Enciphering
1 Substitution ciphers: A substitution cipher is an
encryption technique where units of plaintext are
substituted with ciphertext using a predefined method and
a key. In this approach, characters in the plaintext are
transformed into different characters, numbers, or symbols
based on the given key.
2 Transposition ciphers: A transposition cipher is a
cryptographic technique that rearranges the order of
characters in plaintext to generate ciphertext. Also
referred to as a permutation cipher, this method of
encryption alters the positions of the characters, ensuring
that the original message is disguised.

Caesar Cipher
It is an ancient cryptographic technique that shifts each
character in a plaintext message by a predetermined number of
positions, as determined by a key value. Julius Caesar used this
method in private communications around 58 BC.
Write A to Z in chronology order, assign number using
Mod 26, i.e., A, .....Z, will be assigned as 0,.......25.
Write the plaintext and assign Mod 26 values to each
alphabet of the plaintext(P(x)).
Note the value of Key(k), x; where x is the position of
each alphabet in plain text.
Find Encrypted text/message(E(x))=(x+k)mod26,i.e., k
position right-shifting
For Decryption: P(x) = (x-k)mod26

Advantage & Disadvantage:
The Caesar Cipher is easy to implement, making it simple and
widely understood. However, it has a very small key space (only
26 possible keys), which makes it vulnerable to brute-force
attacks. An attacker can easily try all keys to break the cipher.

1 The Playfair Cipher uses a 5×5 matrix (key table) of
letters for encryption.
letters for encryption.
2 Letters I and J are considered the same to fit 25 letters in
the matrix.
3 The matrix is filled by:
First placing the unique letters of a keyword (in order).
Then filling in the remaining unused letters of the alphabet.
4 The plaintext is encrypted two letters at a time (digraphs).
5 Duplicate letters in a pair (e.g., ”LL”) are separated by
inserting an ‘X’ (e.g., ”LX”). For case ’XX’, Q will be
inserted instead of X.

6 It’s a classical symmetric encryption technique, offering
better security than simple substitution ciphers.

Encryption rule of Playfair Cipher
1 If both letters are in the same row, replace each with the
letter to its right (wrap around if needed). i.e.,
M(r, c) →C(r, (c + 1)mod5), where r and c present row
and column numbers of key-matrix corresponding to the
plaintext alphabet.
2 If both are in the same column, replace each with the
letter below it (wrap around if needed).
3 If in different rows and columns, replace each with the
letter in the same row but opposite corner (rectangle rule).
1 Playfair cipher also known as Playfair square or the
Wheatstone-Playfair cipher.
2 Charles Wheatstone created the technique in 1854, but it
is named after Lord Playfair to promote the use of it.

Hill Cipher
Unlike monoalphabetic ciphers, the Hill cipher is a
polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.
It was developed by Lester S. Hill in 1929.
It is a block cipher of two or three letter, or any size.
The value of n, the block size, depends on the key matrix,
not on the plaintext.
The key must be a square matrix of size (n × n).
Therefore, the plaintext is divided into blocks of (n)
letters.
For example, if the key is a 3×3 matrix, then n=3, and 3
plaintext is encrypted in groups of letters.
In case the key size is not a square, the key would be
padded or trimmed to make the length a perfect. square.

The Rail Fence Cipher is a transposition cipher — it rearranges
the characters of the plaintext into a zigzag pattern across
multiple ”rails” (rows), and then reads the result row-by-row to
produce the ciphertext.
Choose the number of rails (key), say k.
Write the message in a zigzag pattern across the rails.
Read row-by-row to get the ciphertext.
Spaces ( ), commas (,), periods (.), etc., are placed in the

Data Encryption Standard
DES is a symmetric-key block cipher, and Devolped by
IBM Team in the year 1970.
DES is a block cipher with a 56-bit key length.
DES encrypts data in blocks of size of 64 bits each, i.e.,
takes 64 bits of plain text and provides 64 bits of cipher
text.
DES consists of 16 round Feistel structures, each of which
is called a round.

Generation of 48 bit Subkey
Originally key size 64 bit. But, 56 out of 64 bits of key is
used for the generation of key for the different round.
56 bits out of 64 bits can be formed by discarding the
parity bit, i.e., the bit position 8,16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64

XOR operation and S-box
Perform a bitwise XOR operation between Ri−1(E) and Ki
which resulting in another 48-bit value, i.e., Ki ⊕Ri−1(E).
Split 48 bits into 8 groups of each of 6 bits, i.e., , i.e.,
Ki ⊕Ri−1(E) = A1A2A3A4A5A6A7A8.
Ki ⊕Ri−1(E) = A1A2A3A4A5A6A7A8.
Apply the S-table to each Ai containing 6 bits,i.e.,
Bi1Bi2Bi3Bi4Bi5Bi6.
Consider the first and last bits of each group, i.e., AF to
determine the row number in the S-table by converting
them to their equivalent decimal value. The remaining 4
middle bits,i.e., BCDE are considered the column number.
Extract the corresponding value from the S-1 table using
the identified row and column numbers.

Question
Given the output of round 16 in DES as “0x0000 0002 0000
0080”. Find the respective cipher text.
Ans. : Given: Output of round-16 = 0x0000 0002 0000 0080
The above-stated output in hexadecimal form. Please translate
into equivalent binary by replacing each bit of hexadecimal into
4-bit binary.
From above, L16 = (00000002)16 =
4-bit binary.
From above, L16 = (00000002)16 =
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0010
R16 = (00000002)16 =
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1000 0000
So, Input to the IP−1 = R16 + L16
= 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000

Advanced Encryption Standard
AES is a Block Cipher. And developed by the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.
AES is also known as Rijndael Encryption algorithm.
The key size can be 128/192/256 bits.
Encrypts data in blocks of 128 bits each.
Stronger and faster than Triple-DES.
An ideal block cipher requires the encryption to be
injective and surjective (bijective).
Each plaintext maps to a unique ciphertext and each
ciphertext maps to a unique plaintext.

AES operates on 128-bit blocks of data, which is
equivalent to 16 bytes.
equivalent to 16 bytes.
These 16 bytes are denoted as: M0, M1,M2, . . . , M15
If the plaintext is less than 16 bytes, it is padded using
the character ’Z’ until it reaches exactly 16 bytes.
Both the plaintext and the key are arranged into a 4×4
grid (state matrix), filled column-wise.

Mix column
MixColumns is a diffusion operation in AES that mixes the
bytes of each column in the State matrix using matrix
multiplication in a finite field with 256 elements, i.e., GF(28)
(Galois Field).
To build GF(28), we need an irreducible polynomial of
degree 8 over GF(2).
In AES, the chosen irreducible polynomial P(x) =
x8 + x4 + x3 + x + 1(binary: 100011011, hex:0x11B).
That the above-mentioned P(x) is an irreducible
That the above-mentioned P(x) is an irreducible
polynomial as it has no root(α) for either value of 0 or 1,
i.e., P(x)|x=α∈{0,1} ̸= 0.
That the irreducible means it can’t be factored further.
And it is also required for the arithmetic operation in
modulo-2.

Even though there exist multiple numbers of degree 8
irreducible polynomial exist. Then a question arises why
we choosen x8 + x4 + x3 + x + 1?
It is also primitive, meaning that it generates all non-zero
elements of GF(28) through successive powers.
It is very efficient to implement in both hardware and
software.
x8 + x4 + x3 + x + 1 ≡0 mod (x8 + x4 + x3 + x + 1)
⇒x8 = x4 + x3 + x + 1 mod (x8 + x4 + x3 + x + 1)
In Galois fields of modulo-2, both ’+’ and ’-’ are same.
And ’+’ can be replaced by ⊕(bitwise XOR).
x + x = 0,1 + 1 = 0, x2 + x2 = 0, xk + xk = 0
x8 + x4 = x3 + x + 1 mod (x8 + x4 + x3 + x + 1)

Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
Diffie–Hellman (DH) Key Exchange securely shares
Diffie–Hellman (DH) Key Exchange securely shares
cryptographic keys over an insecure channel without their
conversation being transmitted over the internet.
The goal of Diffie-Hellman key exchange is to securely
generate and share a key for symmetric encryption.
It’s a core part of secure protocols like SSL/TLS and SSH,
VPN. SSL – Secure Sockets Layer; TLS – Transport Layer
Security; SSH – Secure Shell; VPNs-Virtual private
networks.
It is also known as exponential key exchange.

Steps of DH Key exchange
Let two end users, Alice and Bob, both are agreed to share
a secret key over an insecure channel.
Consider p and q, such that p is a prime number and q is
a generator of p and primitive root modulo p. And p is a
large number and q is small number.
Choose two personal keys as a and b for Alice and Bob
respectively.
Now compute public key from the both ends as:
Alice: a∗= qamod p
Bob: b∗= qbmod p
Now public key received at other ends is given by:
Alice will receive b∗
Bob will receive a∗

session, so compromising one key doesn’t affect others.
Scalable: Efficient even with many participants—only a
few exponentiations per party are needed.
No Prior Trust Needed: Works without pre-shared secrets,
ideal for first-time communications.

Short note on primitive root
A number g is called a primitive root of modulo n if powers
of g generate all numbers that are coprime to n under modulo
n arithmetic.
n arithmetic.
That is, g1, g2, ...., gk should produce all numbers from 1
to n −1 that are coprime to n, without repetition. Where
k = p −1.
2k ≡1 mod p.
For example, 3 can be a primitive root of modulo 17, and
whereas 2 and 4 can’t be a primitive root of modulo 17.
The private keys, i.e., a, b must be less than p, i.e.,
1 < a, b < p.

RSA Algorithm
RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a classic and widely used
example of public-key cryptography (also known as asymmetric
cryptography).
Two keys are used:
cryptography).
Two keys are used:
Public Key – used to encrypt data; shared openly.
Private Key – used to decrypt data; kept secret by the
owner.
RSA relies on the computational hardness of factoring
large prime numbers.
Application: Secure data transmission, Digital signatures,
SSL/TLS (for HTTPS websites), Email encryption (e.g.,
PGP)

Ans........
Now, we need to compute d = e−1 mod ϕ(n)
From RSA: ed ≡1 mod ϕ(n)
From RSA: ed ≡1 mod ϕ(n)
Now choose smallest k, for which ed = kϕ(n) + 1, i.e., e is a
factor of kϕ(n) + 1.
So, d = k.ϕ(n)+1
e
≡e−1 mod n.
Now, e = 7(given); ϕ(n) = 20(calculated);
by iteration, for k = 1, the e = 7 becomes a factor of
1.20 + 1 = 21. From this, d = 21/7 = 3 mod 20.
Public key = (33,7) and Private Key = (33,3)
Plaintext=M=5, find encrypted message.
Encrypted Message=C= Me mod n = 57

Secure Enclave:
A secure enclave is a special, protected part of a computer’s
processor that keeps sensitive information—like fingerprints,
passwords, or secret keys—safe from hackers and harmful
software. It works separately from the main system so that
even if the rest of the device is attacked, the data inside the
enclave stays protected. This feature is used in modern devices
(like iPhones with Apple’s T2 chip) to make sure your private
data stays private.

Obfuscation:
Obfuscation is a way of hiding how software really works from
hacking, to safeguard intellectual property and reverse
engineering by making its code or data harder to read or
understand. It’s like turning clear instructions into a puzzle, so
that hackers or competitors can’t easily figure out how it works
or steal it. This helps protect sensitive parts of a program and
makes it tougher to break into or copy. A few techniques of
this kind:

Hashing
A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input
(of any length) and transforms it into a fixed-length string of
characters.
Input: Can be of any length (short text, long file, etc.)
Output: Always of fixed length (e.g., 128-bit for MD5,
256-bit for SHA-256)
This process is like compressing a large balloon into a
compact ball — simplifying and reducing the input while
preserving uniqueness.
Each input generates a unique ”fingerprint” (hash). Even
a minor change in input gives a very different hash.
Collision Resistance: It is very difficult to find two different
inputs that produce the same hash value.

Salting
Adding random data (salt) to passwords before hashing.
Enhances password security by making each hash unique,
even for identical passwords.
Defense Against:
1 Rainbow table attacks
2 Brute-force attacks
The salt is combined with the password, then the result is
hashed and stored.
Advantages: Adds unpredictability, making it much harder
for hackers to crack hashed passwords.

Digital Signatures
A digital signature is the electronic version of a
handwritten signature, uniquely tied to the signer and the
document.
Objective: Ensures authenticity, integrity, and
non-repudiation of digital documents.
How It Works:
1 The signer uses their private key to generate a unique
signature.
2 This signature is attached to the document.
3 The recipient uses the public key to verify it.
Confirms the document was not tampered with. And also
proves the signer’s identity and involvement.

Key Stretching
A cryptographic technique that transforms a simple
password into a longer, more secure key.
Objective is to to slow down brute-force or dictionary
attacks by increasing the time needed to guess passwords.
How It Works: Repeatedly applies a hashing algorithm to
make password cracking computationally expensive.
Effect: Increases the time and effort required for hacking
attempts.
Different Techniques:
1 PBKDF2: Applies a hash function multiple times to slow
down key derivation.
2 Bcrypt: Adds salt and uses multiple hashing rounds to
secure passwords.

Blockchain
A digital, decentralized ledger made of linked data batches
called blocks.
Initially created for Bitcoin, but now used across various
sectors.
Structure: Each block contains data and a hash. Blocks
are linked to form a chain, ensuring continuity and security.
Decentralization: Data is distributed across many
computers (nodes). Tampering requires altering every
copy, making it nearly impossible.
Proof of Work:
1 To add a block, a computer must solve a cryptographic
puzzle.
2 This ensures consensus and security before data is
accepted.

It is defined as a digital record of all transactions in a
blockchain network, visible to all participants.
Everyone in the network can view, verify, and audit
transactions in real time.
transactions in real time.
Decentralization:
1 Not controlled by a single authority.
2 Multiple copies are stored across network nodes
(computers).
Security: Highly tamper-resistant due to cryptography and
decentralization.
Transaction Recording: Transactions are broadcast to the
network. Verified by participants based on blockchain
rules.

Certificates
Certificates means digital certificate here, acts like a
digital passport, ensuring secure online interactions.
Used to verify identities and encrypt communications.
Core Elements of Certificate Systems:
Certificate Authorities (CAs) Role: Validate digital
identities using cryptographic keys. Different types of CAs
as follows:
1
Online CA: Fast, real-time verification (less secure).
2
Offline CA: Operates in isolation (more secure).
3
Public CA: Secures internet websites (e.g., DigiCert).
4
Private CA: Used within internal networks.
Root of Trust Root Key:
1
The base of all trust in a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
2
Root Certificate: Self-signed and used to validate all
issued certificates.
3
issued certificates.
3
Devices trust a certificate if it traces back to a trusted

Certificates
CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists):
Lists revoked, expired, or compromised certificates.
Maintained and published by CAs.
Users check serial numbers against the CRL.
Can be large and slower to access.
OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol):
1 Offers real-time certificate validation.
2 Queries CA server for the current status (valid, revoked,
expired).
3 Faster than downloading CRLs.
Types of Certificates:
Self-signed Certificates:
1
Self-signed Certificates:
1
Signed by the same entity that issues it.
2
Not trusted by browsers/public users.
3
Useful for internal use (e.g., development/testing servers).
